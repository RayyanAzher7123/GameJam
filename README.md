Game Jam - PopQuest - A Side Scroller Game

PopQuest is a side-scrolling adventure game developed by my team during the Global Game Jam 2025 and was completed in 48 hours.

Players control a warrior armed with a sword, navigating through levels filled with obstacles like crawlers, narrow platforms, and limited health. The game features an intuitive UI, player stats tracking, and immersive background music to enhance the experience.

The game was built using C# and the Unity game engine, which allowed me to deepen my understanding of game physics, sprite animations, collision detection, UI design, and sound integration. Through this project, I also explored key gameplay mechanics such as player health management, collectibles, level progression, and enemy behavior.

As the team lead, I was responsible for developing the game concept, allocating tasks, and ensuring smooth collaboration. Throughout the Game Jam, we followed an iterative development approach, allowing for incremental progress in gameplay features. My role also involved development, testing, debugging, and refining mechanics to ensure a polished final product.

This project was a valuable experience in both game development and team leadership, strengthening my skills in project management, technical execution, and collaborative problem-solving.

Technologies Used:

Game Engine - Unity for 2D Physics System for collision detection, gravity and movement, rendering 2D graphics, effects and tile maps
Programming Language - C# for game logic, mechanics, and interactions
Version Control - GitHub
